## Introduction

The project focus on utilizing the Smart Costa del Sol API to process real, raw demographic data. It involved transforming geospatial data and adhering to the Medallion architecture for data management. This repository serves as a guide and contains the databricks notebook, a step-by-step guide with screenshots, and a mindmap detailing the entire transformation process. For further exploration and future enhancements, refer to the repository's resources.

## Environment Setup

A stable pipeline begins with a meticulous setup of Azure services. This includes configuring Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Data Factory, Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics. Credentials are secured using best practices, avoiding hardcoding and preparing for the integration of Azure Key Vault for production environments.

## Data Ingestion

The raw data journey starts with the Data Factory pipeline pulling from Smart Costa del Sol API into the Bronze directory. This stage ensures the capture of unprocessed data for the initial layer of the pipeline.

## Data Transformation

Databricks is the cornerstone for data transformation, aligning the schema across datasets and handling complex structures. Transformations such as standardizing census data and merging geographical information are highlighted in the databricks notebook.

## Challenges Encountered

From partitioning data in Azure Synapse to processing GeoJSON with Apache Sedona, the project presented various challenges. Each issue brought insights into Azure's data handling capabilities and data engineering processes, showcasing the importance of adaptability.

## Security Best Practices

Though Azure Key Vault was not used in this temporary setup, it is emphasized that for any permanent production environment, the use of Azure Key Vault for managing secrets is mandatory.

## Data Visualization

The Gold directory houses the transformed data, making it accessible to Power BI for generating insightful visualizations and reports that inform strategic decisions.

## Conclusion

This overview highlights the steps taken to construct a data pipeline using Azure Databricks and Power BI. The GitHub repository is a treasure trove of information, providing all the necessary resources to replicate and understand the demographics data pipeline.
